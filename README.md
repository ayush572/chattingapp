# chattingapp

## This is supposed to be a a full MERN project. As mongodb is an async database, so the Pusher is used to make it a synchronous database, which means that the messages will be uploaded and seen on the chat section as soon as the message is uploaded.


#### Although is project has not been completed due to error in the backend part of node modules, but still it was a good try to do the same.
